For Homework 2 I created an alien using p5.js and shapes like circles, ellipses, rectangles, and lines. After I finished my sketch I aske ChatGPT to generate an AI image of a pretty pink alien.
Some of the choices I made differently from the AI were the facial expression, the shape of the head, and the skin color. The AI-generated image has more detail, shading, and looks smoother
and more polished.

My p5.js drawing looks more flat compared to the AI image because it is made only from basic shapes. The biggest difference between the two was the time it took to create them. My sketch took
hours to make while the AI image was generated in minutes. I chose to make an alien because I wanted to make something fun and challenging.
