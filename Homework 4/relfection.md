Reflection

I used AI to generate a dessert fairy image used in this project. I uaed AI for this image because I wanted a very specific theme (a dessert
fairy) and could not find an image that matched my idea. My prompt described a dessert fairy chasing something. The image was close to what I
expected and helped give personality to the project. The fairy became the main character and made the animation feel more like a small game
instead of moving pictures.
