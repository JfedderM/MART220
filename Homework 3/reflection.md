Reflection 

For homework 3 I upgraded my alien from homework 2 I call it Mood Alien because it changes color and facial expressions when it's clicked on. Once finished I asked AI-to generate a p5.js sketch. The AI sketch shows a moving circle flying across the canvas
while the background changes color then it loops. It feels like a basic animation example from creative coding 1. 

My sketch had a lot more going on compared to the AI sketch for example my sketch is interactive and has a title. The AI sketch could be useful to someone who wants to learn a simple movement on p5.js. It wasn't helpful to me but I was excited to see what
AI would come up with. I was expecting something a little more intricate instead It gave me simple.
